#' TODO mockR added Functionality
#' 
#' 		DONE - Function for cleaning up mock methods
#' 
#' 		mockR does not work when namespace is locked.
#' 		Call sequence tests should not depend on named arguments
#' 		Un-registered method should call default rather than throw error
#' 		Test for specific call sequence
#' 		Return different values from calls
#' 		Assert only methods of specification may be called
#' 		Automatically create mock methods for specification
